II. SORTING

# I. Searching Algorithm
1. Binary Search(Sorted Array)
2. Linear Search

# II. SORTING Algorithm

Arranging a elements based on increasing or decreasing order called as 'Sorting'. We have lot of Sorting algorithms. 
The algorithms are classified below

# Classification
1. Time Complexity
2. Memory Usage or Space complexity
3. Stability
4. Internal sort(Main memory or RAM) vs external sort(Disk)
5. Recursive(Quick sort, Merge sort) or non-recursive(selection sort, insertion sort) 

# Sorting Type
1. Selection Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Quick Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Bubble Sort
